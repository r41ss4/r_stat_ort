| *title*                             | Qualitative, nominal measurement scale                 | It does not have a numerical value nor can operations be performed with it. Furthermore, no category is better than another, so it is categorical nominal. This variable allows you to identify the element (the title works as a name for the element)                 |
| *url*                               | Qualitative, nominal measurement scale                 | It does not have a numerical value nor can operations be performed with it. Furthermore, no category is better than another, so it is categorical nominal. This variable allows you to identify the element (the URL works as a tag for the element) |
